## 1.2.9

* fix(native): prevent Scudo `invalid chunk state` crash in async operations by removing per-task `IsarCore` buffer cleanup when running on long-lived worker pool isolates.

## 1.2.8

* feat: implement static worker pool for parallel execution on native platforms. This reuses isolates to significantly reduce the overhead of asynchronous operations.
* feat: add `Isar.setWorkerCount(int count)` to allow customizing the number of background workers.
* feat: introduce eager initialization of worker isolates ("warm up") to eliminate latency for the first asynchronous call.

## 1.2.7

* ios/macos: switch from CocoaPods to Swift Package Manager (SPM); SPM is now stable
